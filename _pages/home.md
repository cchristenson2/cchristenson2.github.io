# About me
I am currently completing my final semester of the doctoral program in biomedical engineering at UT Austin. I received my B.S from UT San Antonio in biomedical engineering in 2020, and my M.S in 2022 from UT Austin. My curriculum over this time has focused on medical imaging, computational methods, and computer science, which led me into research in computational oncology for my dissertation.
Before starting my PhD I worked in a biophotonics lab for 2 years, developing experimental protocols for the optimization of small molecule detection with a photonic crystal biosensor. I am no longer a wet-lab scientist, but from this experience gained valuable insight into the kind of researcher I wanted to be.

## Research interests
My broad research interests involve building predictive models for cancer patients that can be used to inform clinical decision making, whether through early identification of response, or feedback on patient treatment regimens. With clinical applications in mind, my recent focus has been on dimensionality reduction and uncertianty quantification of numerical simulations for these patients. I am always looking for new methods to identify patterns in data that can be leveraged to improve our decision making frameworks.

## What's next?
I'm currently looking for employment following the successful defense of my dissertation in November 2024. I am primarily looking for a role in biotech/healthcare with an emphasis on the ability to make an imact on clinical outcomes. Please check out my projects or resume for more details about my past experience.
